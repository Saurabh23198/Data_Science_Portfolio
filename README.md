# [Project 2 : Image classification using CNN](https://github.com/Saurabh23198/Image-Classification-Potato-Diseased-Plants)
* Developed a model using Convolutional Neural Network to accurately identify the diseases present in potato plant.
* Used tensorflow library, data augmentation and average pooling to reduce dimensionality and better computation.
* Built a client facing API using FastAPI and tested using POSTMAN.
* Predicted the disease type with accuracy of 97.66%.
